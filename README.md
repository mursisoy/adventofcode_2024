# Advent Of Code 2024

My solutions for the advent of code 2024, deferred. 

First, get dependencies:
```bash
mix deps.get
```

From here, you can:

Run the tests [you can run them for one day]:
```bash
mix test [--only day:1]
```

Get the solution for a given input (place them under `./inputs/day/#/input`)

```bash
mix aoc.solve --day 1
```
